PHASE 1
In this project we implement a fully functional Internet router in "C" that routes real network traffic. The goal is to understand how a router really works. The router runs as a user process locally, and routes real packets that are flowing across the CS department network to application servers.Implemented requirement functionality and demonstrated the correctness by performing traceroute, ping, and web download through the router.

PHASE 2

Simulated prefix hijacking by creating our own IRC network. The server was written in Python and the client was written in Perl with a GUI experience using the tk library. A hack bot was implemented in Perl again to spoof the identity of a legit client and sniff the messages. A solution was also implemented to counter this attack , rest of the details are included in the term paper.
